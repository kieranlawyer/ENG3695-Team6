                            ensure there is not currently an outage or issue on their end.

                            In the event this happens to you, you can hold down the RESET
                            button on the bottom of the router until the LED blinks, and then
                            it will be restored to the router’s defaults.

                            not connected to the internet. If it is green, it is
                            connected to the internet. If it is off, the router is off.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            The modem and router are two very distinct, but just as integral
                            pieces of equipment to setting up internet in your home. The modem
                            is what connects to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to your home,
                            the router is what actually distributes this connection to your devices.

                            5. Are there any ways to improve the performance of my router without upgrading it or my internet?
                        </label>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            There are some tips you can employ to try and optimize performance within your house.
                            Try to place the router in a central location, and try not to have anything interrupting
                            or interferring with the signal in between it and  whatever it is connecting to. This includes
                            bluetooth devices, microwaves, metal, and walls.
                        </p>

                    <input checked type="checkbox" name="q6" id="q6">

                    <div class="panel-header">

                            6. Can I use my DBit N300 with a mesh network?
                        </label>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            The DBit N300 is not designed with mesh networks in mind.
                            While theoretically, you could use it with a compatible mesh
                            network or extender, it will not truly be a part of the mesh network.
                            For a better option for you, we recommend our other model, the DBit
                            AX1800.

                            7. Does the Dbit N300 support power over ethernet (PoE)?
                        </label>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            The Dbit N300 does not support power over ethernet. At this time, none of
                            our products support this feature. If this is something you would like for us

                            8. What does my NAT type mean, and can I change it? 
                        </label>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            NAT stands for Network Address Translation and it is 
                            a process used by routers to manage multiple devices by applying
                            a public IP address to all of them. If it is open, the router is not
                            blocking any traffic. This is best for things like gaming and streaming.
                            If it is moderate, it is filtering some traffic, but most is going through.
                            It is a balance between open and the next type, strict. Strict is when your router
                            is filtering traffic heavily, which may lead to issues with things like gaming, but
                            will keep you more secure. If you are having issues with your NAT type, try to enable
                            Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), as this should help tune your network to what you are 
                            currently doing.

                            9. What are the benefits of my own router over using an ISP's?
                        </label>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            By getting your own router, you can save money in fees, and buying your own
                            router can often help get you exactly what fits your needs. The main benefit
                            of purchasing through an ISP is that it will come configured for you. However,
                            with this website you can get it configured in no time!
