                            The modem and router are two very distinct, but just as integral
                            pieces of equipment to setting up internet in your home. The modem
                            is what connects to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to your home,
                            the router is what actually distributes this connection to your devices.

                            Try to place the router in a central location, and try not to have anything interrupting
                            or interferring with the signal in between it and whatever it is connecting to. This
                            includes bluetooth devices, microwaves, metal, and walls.

                            By getting your own router, you can save money in fees, and buying your own
                            router can often help get you exactly what fits your needs. The main benefit
                            of purchasing through an ISP is that it will come configured for you. However,

                            Port forwarding is a networking technique that allows external devices to access services on
                            a private network by mapping an external port to an internal port on a specific device. When
                            a router receives incoming traffic on a designated port, it forwards the data to a specific
                            local IP address and port within the network. This is commonly used for hosting game
                            servers, remote desktop access, and running web servers from home networks.

                        <p>
                            For example, if you're hosting a Minecraft server on your computer (which listens on port
                            25565), you can configure your router to forward incoming traffic on port 25565 to your
                            computer's local IP address. Without port forwarding, external devices wouldn't be able to
                            initiate a connection because most home routers block unsolicited inbound traffic for
                            security reasons. However, improper configuration can expose devices to security risks, so
                            it's important to forward only necessary ports and use firewalls where possible.

                            You can toggle UPnP on and off in the router web interface

                        <p>
                            Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a networking protocol that allows devices to automatically
                            discover and communicate
                            with each other on a local network without manual configuration. One of its key features is
                            automatic port forwarding,
                            where applications (like game servers, VoIP services, or peer-to-peer software) can request
                            the router to open specific
                            ports as needed, eliminating the need for users to configure port forwarding manually.

                        <p>
                            UPnP makes setting up networked applications more convenient, but it comes with security
                            risks. Since any device or
                            application on the local network can request ports to be opened, malware or unauthorized
                            programs could exploit this to
                            expose a system to external threats. For this reason, many security-conscious users disable
                            UPnP and manually configure
                            port forwarding instead.

                            Once your bandwidth becomes saturated, your connection may become slow. It may also
                            become slow if there is too much internal traffic being handled by the router such as if
                            smart home devices are misbehaving or large media like security videos are being

                            Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol that
                            automatically assigns IP addresses and
                            other network settings to devices on a network. Instead of manually configuring each
                            device
                            with an IP address, subnet
                            mask, gateway, and DNS settings, a DHCP server dynamically distributes this information,
                            ensuring that devices can
                            connect to the network without conflicts or manual intervention.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            When a device joins a network, it sends a DHCP Discover request to locate a DHCP server.
                            The
                            server responds with a DHCP
                            Offer, suggesting an available IP address and configuration settings. The device then
                            sends
                            a DHCP Request to accept the
                            offer, and the server finalizes the process with a DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK). This
                            process
                            simplifies network
                            management, especially in environments with many devices, such as home networks,
                            offices,
                            and large enterprises.
                            However, DHCP leases are temporary, meaning devices may receive different IP addresses
                            over
                            time unless they have a
                            static reservation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The recommended settings will ensure your router will assign IPs to each device upon
                            connecting via DHCP.
