                <br>

                <p>
                    If you are unable to find the wifi network, ensure you router is on
                    and connected to the internet (Green indicator light). Attempt to establish
                    connection via an ethernet cable. If that works, go to the router web page, and
                    check the network name to ensure you were looking for the right one. If you can connect
                    via ethernet but cannot find the network, contact us.

                <p>
                    The default login is on the router itself. If you have changed the login, you can click the reset
                    button on the back of the router to reset the login to the default, and then use it to log in.

                <p>
                    This could have many causes. Restart the router to see if that resolves the issue. Check with your
                    ISP to see if they are aware of any traffic or reason for the slow connections. Ensure the router is
                    in an open area to ensure it can transmit well. Consider purchasing WiFi extenders to ensure the
                    furthest rooms in your house have access to a strong connection.

                    This is a problem that could have mutliple solutions. Are they inputting the correct password?
                    Consider double checking the password on the web page. Try to restart the router. Try to connect
                    with an ethernet cable. Check the indicator light to ensure the router is showing a connection.
                    Try out a different ethernet cable for the connection to the modem. This should help you diagnose
                    what exactly is failing for you. If you wre still unable to connect, contact us.
