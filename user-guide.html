                <p>
                    In the box, you should have:

                    On the back of the N300 you will find a few different ports:

                <p>
                    Connect the power cord to a source of power, then connect the other side of the cable to the port on
                    the back of the routed labeled <span class="highlight">DC IN</span>. You should now see a

                        the Dbit N300 to the other side of your house from the first router will allow for enhanced

                    First, open the web browser using the device you connected to the N300 network on.

                    Wait one minute, then repeat <a href="#step-2">step 2</a> to re-connect to the network, and repeat

                <p>
                    The <span class="highlight">SSID</span> is the name of the network. This is what appears in the WiFi
                    list on your devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span class="highlight">password</span> is required to connect to the network. This is not
                    associated with the login to the control panel.

                <br>

                <p>
                    You may pick any SSID you find suitable, so long as it is no longer than
                    <span class="highlight">32 characters</span> and does not contain illegal characters.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    It is recommended to pick a <span class="highlight">secure</span> password. As a general rule of
                    thumb:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make them long</li>
                    <li>Make them random</li>
                    <li>Make them unique</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Your networks security is dependent on a secure choice of password. If your password is too weak,
                    attackers may join your network and monitor activity. They may be able to extract login credentials
                    or access tokens from websites you visit.
                    <span class="highlight">It is imperative you pick a secure password.</span>
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    For more information on picking a secure password, please refer to
                    <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world/use-strong-passwords">this resource</a>.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Once you have updated the SSID and password, click the <span class="highlight">Save</span> button at
                    the bottom center of the page.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">NOTE: </span> Once you save the settings, you will be kicked from the

                    Unfortunately, the router control panel is still easily accessible from anyone connected
                    to the network. Further setup is required to secure the control panel. Head to
                    <a href="#step-5">step 5</a> for futher setup.

                <p>The final step of necessary setup is to secure the control panel.</p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Navigate to the <span class="highlight">System</span> page using the navigation menu on the left. At
                    the top of the page, you should see the following configuration box:
                </p>

                <div class="pic-container">
                    <img src="assets/images/admin.png" alt="Picture of the control panel login configuration box.">
                    <p>Control panel login configuration</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Type the old password (by default <span class="highlight">admin</span>) into the <span
                        class="highlight">Old password</span> box.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Pick a new password. Refer back to <a href="#step-4">step 4</a> for information on picking a secure
                    password. It is recommended to save this password somewhere safe - either physically write it on a
                    piece of paper and store it in a safe place, or use a password manager.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    The password picked must be between <span class="highlight">8-30</span> characters and must contain
                    1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 number. It can NOT contain special characters.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Once you have picked a new password and securely saved it down, type it into both the
                    <span class="highlight">New password</span> and <span class="highlight">Confirm password</span>
                    boxes.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Finally, click the <span class="highlight">Save</span> button at the bottom center of the page.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    You will be sent back to the login page. Login with your new credentials to ensure you still have
                    access.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    If you find yourself unable to login to the control panel, you may
                    <span class="highlight">Factory reset</span> your router to restore default configuration. To do so,
                    hold the <span class="highlight">RESET</span> button on the back of the router down for 10 seconds.
                    Wait one minute, then you must repeat the setup instructions starting from
                    <a href="#step-2">step 2</a>.

                <p>
                    Quality of Service (QoS) allows you to prioritize network traffic to ensure that critical
                    applications receive sufficient bandwidth. This is especially useful for reducing lag in online
                    gaming, ensuring smooth video streaming, and preventing slowdowns during video calls.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    In this section, you may configure bandwidth limits per each device connected to the network. You
                    may also temporarily disable certain devices from accessing the internet. These devices remain
                    connected to your router but are no longer sucking up precious bandwidth. Disabled devices will be
                    temporarily moved to the "Prohibited devices" section. You may delete them from this section to
                    re-enable their internet connection.

                    the router page will prevent you from being able to access the router page to re-enable the
                    connection. If this happens, you must connect from a new device, log in, and remove your devices
                    from the "Prohibited devices" section.
