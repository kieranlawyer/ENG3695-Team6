                <p>
                    On the back of the N300 you will find a few different ports, 
                    and in your box it should have an ethernet cord and a power cord. 
                    Connect the power cord to a source of power, and the port on the far 
                    right side. On the port directly to the left, connect one side of the 
                    ethernet cable, and the other goes into your modem.

                <br>

                <p>
                    To log into the router itself you will need to go to a search engine and 
                    enter the following IP address: 192.168.10.1. There is a default login on 
                    the bottom of your router, or you may need to enter your selected username 
                    and password if you changed them.

                <br>

                <p>
                    Once connected and logged into the web interface, head to the internet section 
                    on the left side, and select ‘DHCP’. Then, go to down to the wifi section, and 
                    setup your SSID and Password. The SSID is simply the name for your wifi, and your 
                    password will help you keep your network secure.

                    Under the 'QoS' tab, you are able to check what devices are connected to your network and 
                    limit their internet access altogether. Turn off the internet access for the gaming 
                    console, tablets, computers, or anything else your kids have connected to wifi, whenever
                    you need to.

                    In the same tab as above, the 'QoS' tab, you are able to set up an upload and download speed limit to
                    ensure no one device is hogging all of the network.

                <p>
                    Under the 'WiFi' tab, you are able to enable a guest network, set it's name and password,
                    and toggle it on or off. Use this to allow others to connect to your network without 
                    compromising the security of your network.

                <p>
                    Under the 'System' tab, you are able to check for updates, and update if there is one available.
                    It is best practice to check for these updates at least once a month, as they often include
                    valuable security patches and performance improvements that helps keep your network running
                    safely and quickly.

                    Note: Your network will be down during the update period, but should automatically reconnect to
                    the modem, and your devices in turn.
